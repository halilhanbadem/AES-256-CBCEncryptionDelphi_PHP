# AES-256-CBC Encryption Delphi&PHP
Delphi Encryption - PHP Decryption. OpenSSL method usage and AES type AES-256-CBC


# DECCrypt 

To access the DECCrypt component, please go to the following address: https://github.com/StephenGenusa/DCPCrypt

There are files in the Repository that belong to this component. 

You should introduce these source files to Library via Delphi. Whether you want this repository, you can download and promote it through the repository of the original publisher.

# Use
Use of the prepared library can be found in the repository.

PHP Function:
  ```
    AES256CBCEnc("halilhanbadem utf8 karakter testi: ÜÖÇŞİ", "12345678123456781234567812345678", "1234567812345678");
  ```  
**!!!!Important!!!!:** 

The IV key must be 16 characters.
The AES key must be 32 characters.

Less or more is unacceptable!


# Description
The library file was taken from a site. 
Other operations(PHP and Demo) have been performed by me.
In AES encryption, you can encrypt the POST or GET information you send to PHP and analyze it back. 
Thanks to the functions available in PHP, you can quickly perform encryption and decoding. 

# IV(Initialization Vector) Key
The IV Switch is optional. I recommend you use it for safety.
